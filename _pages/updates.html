* August 2024:
  * I am happy to share that I attended the annual conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN 2024) in Boston, where I had the opportunity to present a poster on our paper, 'Visual Feature-Based Brain Decoding Yields Weight Maps Better Aligned with Scene Understanding than Classification'.

* May 2024:
  * I am delighted to announce that our paper has been accepted for a poster presentation at the 7th Annual Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN) in August 2024. I am looking forward to presenting our research at this event.

* April 2024:
  * I'm proud to have presented our work 'Neural Speech Decoding: Leveraging Deep Learning for future brain-computer interface' alongside my brilliant lab members and under the guidance of my advisor, Prof. Yao Wang. Iâ€™m grateful for the positive feedback and engaging discussions we shared at the exhibit, and I look forward to the developments ahead for this project!
 
* April 2024:
  * I attended NYC Computer Vision Day 2024 at NYU and was excited to represent the video lab alongside my lab mates. The event was a great experience with insightful talks from experts. I learned a great deal from the presentations and discussions with my peers!
