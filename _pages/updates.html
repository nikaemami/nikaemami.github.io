  <li><strong>February 2025:</strong>
    <p>I had the chance to attend ‘NYC Computer Vision Day 2025’ and present our lab's work through a poster session. It was exciting to share our research, get great feedback, and see how many people were interested in what we’re working on. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XDAJBS6aynQZ87BV2Pa9d78jLsxJnxOH/view?usp=sharing" style="color: #b8860b;">Poster can be found here.</a></p>

  <li><strong>August 2024:</strong>
    <p>I am happy to share that I attended the annual conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN 2024) in Boston, where I had the opportunity to present a poster on our paper, <a href="https://2024.ccneuro.org/pdf/421_Paper_authored_CCN_2024_Neuro_original.pdf" style="color: #b8860b;"> Visual Feature-Based Brain Decoding Yields Weight Maps Better Aligned with Scene Understanding than Classification</a>.</p>

  <li><strong>April 2024:</strong>
    <p>I'm proud to have presented our work 'Neural Speech Decoding: Leveraging Deep Learning for future brain-computer interface' alongside my brilliant lab members and under the guidance of my advisor, Prof. Yao Wang at the Tandon
Research Excellence Exhibit, New York, April 2024. I’m grateful for the positive feedback and engaging discussions we shared at the exhibit, and I look forward to the developments ahead for this project!<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wdHR5kkEjznsnFPBfEYDsgFhV2G0tIF9/view" style="color: #b8860b;">Poster can be found here.</a></p>
